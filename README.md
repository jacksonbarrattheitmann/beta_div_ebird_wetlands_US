# beta_div_ebird_wetlands_US
Spatial beta-diversity investigation of isolated wetlands in CONUS.

## R scripts

1_get_ebird_data_from_big_query: WILL NOT RUN. This script grabs the eBird data from CTC's cloud database with eBird data. It is provided in the data folder
under "Data/ebird_local_alpha_level/". 

4_creating_dataframe_for_just_GIWs_filtered: this script does a lot of the preliminary filtering of the data, including dealing with group submitted checklists, 'X' in teh abundnace column, and 'complete checklists'. The output is "Data/ebird_local_alpha_level/ebird_alpha_wetlands_raw". 

5_creating_env_matrix_for_alpha_ebird_data: this script appends Google Earth Engine data, wetland area, and EPA ecoregion level data into an env matrix that is 207 rows long (same number of GIWs). 

6_creating_site_species_matrix_GIWs_only: this is a preliminary script that creates the a 'wet_comm' dataframe object, that is a 207 row site x species matrix, with sites listed as .rownames. This species and abundance is aggregated across 73 checklists for each GIW, the smallest common denominator for submitted checklists across all sites. 

## Data
1. ebird_local_alpha_level:
   a. ebird_local_alpha_level_raw.RDS: this file is the cleaned and collated version of the other 9 RDS files in this folder. It is the one primarily used in the analysis, and for aggregating beta diversity among JUST GIWs.
